# Self-consistency

With self-consistency prompting, the model generates multiple candidate answers to a question. 
These are then compared against each other, and the most consistent or frequent answer is selected 
as the final output. A good example of self-consistency prompting with LLMs is in the context of 
fact verification or information synthesis, where accuracy is paramount.
